        TOBB ETU Computer Science Community was founded in April 2022 as a student community. The primary goal of this community
        is to create opportunities for students to develop themselves socially and technically. To achieve this goal, we
        organize online and face-to-face events, participate in national and international competitions, and develop
        open-source projects. We are ready to collaborate with people from all over Turkey and from all levels of
        education for our community.

msgstr "TOBB ETU Computer Science Community was founded in April 2022 as a student community. The primary goal of this community is to create opportunities for students to develop themselves socially and technically. To achieve this goal, we organize online and face-to-face events, participate in national and international competitions, and develop open-source projects. We are ready to collaborate with people from all over Turkey and from all levels of education for our community. <br> <br> You can reach our different platform accounts at <a href='https://linktr.ee/tobbbilgisayartoplulugu'>Linktr.ee</a>"
